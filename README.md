  | Hermann, Mario, Tobias Pentek, and Boris Otto. "Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios." *2016 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)*. IEEE, 2016. [전체 그림] | 1. Internet of Everything(IOT) into the industrial value chain is next industrial revolution. 2. Industrie 4.0 = Technical Assistance(Virtual Assistance, Physical Assistance) + Interconnection(Collaboration, Standards, Security) + Information Transparency(Data Analytics, Information Provision) + Decentralized Decisions |


- Smart Supply Chain

  | title                                    | Contents                                 |

  | Ivanov, Dmitry, and Boris Sokolov. "Structure dynamics control approach to supply chain planning and adaptation." International Journal of Production Research 50.21 (2012): 6133-6149 | 1. The dynamics of SC execution creates new business opportunities but also new risks and uncertainty [1.5 Collabo] 2. A crucial topic is the impact of uncertainty and disruption [1. Flexibility ] 3. So the representation of SCs as complex multi-structural dynamic systems can be favourable both for the identifying structures and corresponding models and for the identification of different structural relations from static and dynamic points of view [1.4 Manufacturing Share] 4. How shall these services be schedueld at the planning stage and rescheduled(adapted) in dynamics at the execution control stage? [1.3 Manufacturing Line] 5. Control schemes for the real-time adaptation of an autonomy level are needed [1.4 Manufacturing Share + 1.3 Manufacturing Line ] |

  - Smart Factory

Smart manufacturing is application of networked information-based technologies throughout the manufacturing & SCM 2. SM solves greater manufacturing complexity, dynamics-based economics, radically different performance objectives and has advantage of demand-driven product profiles increase, innovation & faster time-to-market for new product |
